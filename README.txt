ACCOUNTS-PROJECT

This project was created using Spring Tools Suite and is known to run with that IDE.
It should run in eclipse too but if not please install and run it off sts:

https://spring.io/tools/sts

The following instructions are with the use of the sts IDE:

1. Import the project into your IDE as a maven project.
2.Once this has loaded in Right click the root directory "accounts[boot]" and run as a java application.
3.select "App - com.boot" and then RUN.
4.Once the console returns 'Started App in XXXX seconds' the application should be running.
5.The web app can then be accessed through http:://localhost:8080/index.html
6.You can know navigate through the app.
7.To access the database you can go to http://localhost:8080/h2
8.Click 'Connect' and you should now be in the H2 database console.
9.The ACCOUNT database is where the data is being stored.


**IN PROGRESS**
The web app navigation is functioning however, there is an issue with storing/displaying the data. Attempting data storage through the web app stores all fields as NULL.
Also Viewing the data on the accounts.html page displays nothing.
